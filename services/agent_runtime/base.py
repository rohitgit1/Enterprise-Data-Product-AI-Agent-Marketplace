"""The agent runtime adapter interface (BUILD.md section 3, M6.3).

The marketplace catalogues and governs agents; it does not author them. What it
needs from a runtime is narrow and identical whichever one is configured:

    ask(request) -> Answer

An :class:`Answer` carries the four things the marketplace's guarantees are
built on — the answer body, the citations behind every number in it, the KPI
definitions it answered under, and the trace of what it actually did. A runtime
that cannot produce those cannot be adapted, because there would be nothing to
validate.

Two implementations ship: ``analytic`` (deterministic, executes real queries
against the demo tier, no model) and ``cortex`` (Snowflake Cortex Agents). The
runtime is chosen by ``AGENT_RUNTIME``; nothing above this module knows which
one answered.
