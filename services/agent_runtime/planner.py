"""Turning a question into a query plan.

The analytic runtime answers by executing a query, so something has to decide
*which* query. That decision is made here, from three governed inputs and
nothing else:

* the agent's **coverage map** — which KPI, at which grains and slices;
* the **KPI definition** — the numerator, denominator or expression, resolved
  from the register rather than re-derived;
* the **analysis type** the exchange declares.

The planner never invents a measure and never reaches for a column outside the
agent's binding. A question it cannot place against the coverage map is out of
scope, and saying so is the correct answer (10.2).

Analysis types collapse into four shapes. Forty-odd names in the question bank
describe what a reader sees, not what the database does: a Pareto, a driver
ranking and a compliance ranking are all "group by a slice and order by the
measure", and pretending otherwise would mean forty near-identical query
builders drifting apart.
