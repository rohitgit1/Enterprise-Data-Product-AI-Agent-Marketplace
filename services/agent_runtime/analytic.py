"""The deterministic analytical runtime.

This is a real agent runtime, not a stub: it resolves the question against the
agent's coverage map, builds a query from the certified KPI definition, executes
it against the demo tier, and composes the answer from the rows that came back.
Every number in an answer is computed from data the agent is granted, and every
one of them is cited.

Two things it deliberately does not do. It does not call a language model, so it
reports zero tokens rather than inventing a plausible count — a trace that lies
about what happened is worse than no trace. And it does not hold a single
canned answer: give it a different demo tier and it returns different numbers,
which is what "no mocked answers exist" (M6 acceptance) has to mean.

The narrative it writes is assembled from the computed rows, so a claim in prose
and a number in the table cannot disagree.
