"""`/api/v1/agents` — catalog, detail, the demo set, invocation and feedback.

The invocation route is the one the whole marketplace is judged by. Its four
outcomes are all part of the contract, not just the first:

* **200** an answer with its citations, its certified definitions and its trace;
* **403** the caller cannot invoke this agent, or cannot read what it needs —
  naming the missing scope and a pre-filled request;
* **422** out of scope, naming the boundary, the agents that do cover it, and a
  demand link;
* **424** the answer could not be grounded, so it was withheld.

Nothing here decides those; :mod:`services.agents.ask` does, and it does so in a
fixed order with grounding after the runtime and before serialisation.
