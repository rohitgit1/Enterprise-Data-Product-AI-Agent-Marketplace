"""M3.2-M3.5 — the harvest passes, run against the stand-in platform.

These run the real statements through the real read-only guard and the real
mapping into the canonical model. Only where the rows come from differs from a
Snowflake account, so a change to a harvest query is exercised here rather than
silently diverging.
