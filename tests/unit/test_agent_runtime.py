"""M6.3 — the runtime adapters, the registry, and what they refuse.

The claim these tests defend is the one the milestone's acceptance criterion
makes: no mocked answers exist. So the analytic runtime is exercised against the
real demo tier and asserted to change its answer when the data changes, and the
registry is asserted to refuse rather than substitute.
