"""M11 — the front page: what it promotes, what it may say, and where it settles.

Three properties are worth pinning, because all three fail silently:

    the constellation layout is deterministic, so the picture in a deck matches
    the picture on the page;

    the activity ticker never serves an event below the rubric's occurrence
    floor, so it cannot become a side channel onto one team's activity;

    the theatre replays only recorded traces that are still recent, so a stale
    answer cannot survive a regression on the marketing surface.
